            <p>Fine, Java MIGHT be a good example of what a programming language should be like. But Java applications are good examples of what applications SHOULDN’T be like. (pixadel) The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should therefore be regarded as a criminal offense. (E.W. Dijkstra) It’s ridiculous to live 100 years and only be able to remember 30 million bytes. You know, less than a compact disc. The human condition is really becoming more obsolete every minute. (Marvin Minsky) There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works. (Alan J. Perlis) First learn computer science and all the theory. Next develop a programming style. Then forget all that and just hack. (George Carrette)</p>

            <h3>Aside</h3>
            <p>If it keeps up, man will atrophy all his limbs but the push-button finger. (Frank Lloyd Wright) The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time. (Tom Cargill) I’ve noticed lately that the paranoid fear of computers becoming intelligent and taking over the world has almost entirely disappeared from the common culture. Near as I can tell, this coincides with the release of MS-DOS. (Larry DeLuca) The Internet? Is that thing still around? (Homer Simpson) Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen. (Edward V Berard)</p>

            <p>Don’t worry if it doesn’t work right. If everything did, you’d be out of a job. (Mosher’s Law of Software Engineering) The most amazing achievement of the computer software industry is its continuing cancellation of the steady and staggering gains made by the computer hardware industry. (Henry Petroski) I think Microsoft named .Net so it wouldn’t show up in a Unix directory listing. (Oktal) A hacker on a roll may be able to produce–in a period of a few months–something that a small development group (say, 7-8 people) would have a hard time getting together over a year. IBM used to report that certain programmers might be as much as 100 times as productive as other workers, or more. (Peter Seebach) Software undergoes beta testing shortly before it’s released. Beta is Latin for “still doesn’t work”. (Anonymous)</p>
